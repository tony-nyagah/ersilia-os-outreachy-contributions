# üåü Intern Progress Tracker  
Welcome! Use this issue to track your progress as you work through the AI/ML modeling exercise. Follow each step, check the boxes when completed, and update your issue as you go.

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Entry tasks**
- [x] Motivation letter posted in this issue
- [x] Installed the Ersilia Model Hub and successfully run models!
- [ ] Recorded system settigns in this issue
- [ ] Explained completed tests of Ersilia in the issue

---

##  **1. Download a Dataset of Interest**
- [ ] Created a fork of this repository to work on
- [ ] Selected a dataset from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)
- [ ] Verified that the dataset is a classification problem*
- [ ] Read and understood the dataset‚Äôs background and endpoint  
- [ ] Assessed computational feasibility (size, features, etc.)  
- [ ] Downloaded the dataset using Python  
- [ ] Saved data in the `/data` folder  
- [ ] Started writing documentation in the README (Installation, dataset details, how to run code)  

---

##  **2. Featurise the Data**
- [ ] Browsed Ersilia Model Hub for "Representation" models  
- [ ] Selected an appropriate featuriser and justified my choice  
- [ ] Implemented featurisation in a notebook or script
- [ ] Ensured the process is reproducible 
- [ ] Updated the README with featurisation instructions  

---

##  **3. Build an ML Model**
- [ ] Selected an ML framework
- [ ] Trained the model on featurised data  
- [ ] Evaluated the model (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)  
- [ ] Created graphs using Matplotlib for better visualization  
- [ ] Ensured all steps are reproducible  
- [ ] Documented the model-building process in README

---

##  **4. Prepare Code for Review**
- [ ] Double-checked that documentation is clear and complete  
- [ ] Evaluated if my model performance is satisfactory 
- [ ] Identified possible improvements  
- [ ] Updated this issue to request a review 

---

##  **5. Stretch Tasks (Optional)**
- [ ] Tried a different **featuriser**  
- [ ] Tested other **ML architectures**  
- [ ] Applied the model to **public datasets (e.g., ChEMBL)**  
- [ ] Any other improvements? (Describe below)
